# Air Hockey

### [Play game](https://rhalupczok.github.io/Air-Hockey/)

The game was created inspired by standard Air Hockey game which you can find in many touristic places.
At the begining I saw a simple pong game and decided to connect the pong game idea with phisics of colliding circle objects
It is one on my first projects made directly after I met first JavaScript possibilities. Using classes, expressions, RWD

The phisics of hitting the ball was created based on real phisics laws, taken into acount all movement vectors and masses of ball/players.
There is also taken into account the table friction to add more reality
When the time is up, the friction is increased like in real AirHockey game
